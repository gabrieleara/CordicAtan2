# CORDICAtan2

A VHDL specification of a CORDIC interface used to calculate the atan2 value from a pair of coordinates.

## The assignement

This project has beed developed for the Digital Systems Design course of Embedded Computing Systems Master degree at Scuola Sant'Anna of Pisa.
The Project consists in the delevopment of a VHDL specification and Vivado&copy; Design Suite implementation of a CORDIC interface that can be used to calculate the atan2 value from a pair of coordinates.
